OpenBroadcaster - Server Installation Instructions


These instructions are an alternative to using ob.installer.sh.


1. See dependencies.txt for server dependencies.  Mostly PHP/MySQL related, but 
   a few things (python/gstreamer) to support transcoding and media 
   identification. 

2. Copy server files to a web environment (web document root).

3. Import db/dbclean.sql to a database.

4. Copy config.sample.php to config.php, and edit as necessary.

5. Ensure media storage directories are writable by the web server.

6. In the web document root, create 'assets', 'assets/profile_img', and
   'assets/uploads' directories.  These directories should be writable by the
   web server.

7. The database import includes one user.  The username is admin.  The password
   is something you must set in the database as follows (PHP):

   mysql_query('UPDATE users set password = "'.password_hash($new_password.OB_HASH_SALT, PASSWORD_DEFAULT).'"
                where username = "admin"');

8. Log into OpenBroadcaster as admin, and access http://ob_install_url/updates/ to
   verify your installation and run any required updates.
